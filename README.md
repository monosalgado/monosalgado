I’m a **Cybersecurity graduate student, researcher, and teaching assistant** with a strong background in **computer science, defensive security, and applied security research**. My main interests are **blue team operations, detection engineering, SOC automation, and using LLMs to reduce analyst toil**.

I enjoy building practical security tooling, research prototypes, and educational labs that connect theory with real-world security operations.
